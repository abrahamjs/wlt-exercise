# Exercise Project
Interview Exercise for all Williams Lea Tag candidates. The intention of this exercise is to put a candidate through various exercises in an environment similar to how things are here at Williams Lea Tag. Candidates will be judged by a few points;
 
* How the candidate codes different modules
* How the candidate organizes their code
* How closely the candidate follows instructions

It is highly recommended that [npm and node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) are first installed on a candidateâ€™s machine in order to start. This project will involve using ReactJS, however the candidate decides to tackle this project is up to them. It should be known that the reviewer will most likely be using VS Code after they clone it and begin reviewing.
 
Project was created by running `npx create-react-app wlt-exercise`. When forking this repository for the first time, it is necessary to first `cd wlt-exercise` into the directory and then run `npm install` to set up the project and have it ready for development.
